Introduction -- 
--------------------

In this Project our primary target is to promote afforestation by planting more trees. As we
know, global warming is one of the most alarming and sensitive issues of the current
scenario which is mainly caused by deforestation though there are some other causes like
excessive burning of fossil fuels, distorted agricultural practices and destructive human
activities but out of all these causes deforestation is the major cause.
Though we are students of computer applications, we see this project as an opportunity to
do something for our mother nature. So we decided to design a website which will solve
the environmental problems.

Project Purpose:-
--------------------

1. This is a web application which solves environmental problems like deforestation and
global warming by planting more trees.
2. There are two entities into the project one is the Partner who is related to an NGO group
and another one is the User.
3. User will create a green point request via its end and the partner can accept it.
4. A partner can accept that request and then after going through the details he can make
the plantation there and submit it.

How it will work:-
--------------------

What User can do:-
--------------------

1.
    1. Users can register themselves as a Part of it..
    2. Users can login by themselves.
    3. Users can Tell NGOâ€™s about any place that can be used to plant trees, for that user can
    provide their area, locality, and also provide his pinpoint/geolocation so that the NGO gets
    notified easily .
    4.User can take a picture of the location and add a description to it which the NGO can
    refer to before taking the task.
    
2.

   5.All these details entered by User will get stored in the Database in the Back-End.
   6.More than that the User can track the task activity from where User can see that what is
   the status of his requested task is it still pending, accepted by the NGO or the plantation
   has been completed.
    
What an NGO partner can do:-
-----------------------------


1. He is able to login or register himself as an NGO partner.
2. He can see through all his work and task activities.
3. He has different categories from where he can choose the Targets and Location Points
that were created by the user.He can Choose the Tasks that are not being assigned to
anyone and are anonymous.
4. After choosing the target the task will be assigned to the NGO partner.
5. The NGO partner will be responsible for the Work Activity/task till the work is completed.
6. Assigned Partner can able to access his geolocation/pinpoint Location and locate like
(Where to do the Plantation, How Much area is there. What's that location?)
7. After doing all the work. They have to Click on Complete and provide the Valid Proof with
photographs that they have done the work as well they have to write the proper
description that tells about what he did to the work.
8. After Clicking to the Complete and submitting the proof the task gets away from their
Task Portal and it gets stored in the History section of that Partner.

Functionalities:-
--------------------

1. User and partner Authorization
2. Use of geolocation
3. Message sending option
4. Image sharing option
5. User control over sharing their phone number, and email to NGO
6. Progress tracking
7. NGOs have a choice to accept or deny a task.
8. Rating of NGO based on their performance (to be added in future).
9. After the completion of the task the NGO partner will be eligible to get a certificate for
their work.(to be added in future)
10.Many more functionalities to be added in the future by the team according to the
necessity and demand of this project.
